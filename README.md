# SimpleTimerApp

## Description

I tried to follow one *principle*:
> if possible move all functionality into the `ViewModel` or extract it into a `Service`.

## Core Module

The underlying `core` module was extracted and can be fount here: [ArchServices](https://github.com/DanielKnauf/ArchServices) 

Here it is received from [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io) and included as a dependency: 
```
allprojects {
   repositories {
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
   }
}

dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.DanielKnauf:archservices:master-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
